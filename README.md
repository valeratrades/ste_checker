`ste_checker` reads Markdown. It reports the text that does not agree with ASD-STE100
(Simplified Technical English).

These are the rules that a program can apply: the approved wordlist, the part of speech
of each word, the length of each sentence, noun clusters, the passive voice, compound
tenses, -ing forms and contractions.

The standard has 53 rules. This program has 10 of them. A reader who understands the
text must apply the other 43. ASD and STEMG do not endorse this program, and it
certifies nothing. Use it as an aid, not as a gate.

A word can be approved in one part of speech and not in another. *Work* is an approved
noun and an unapproved verb. `ste_checker` tags each word before it reads the wordlist.
Thus "Do not work the lever" is a finding, but "The work is done" is not.

## Usage
Give all the files to one process. The language model loads one time, then each file
costs approximately 100 microseconds.

```sh
ste_checker docs/.readme_assets/usage.md docs/.readme_assets/installation.md
```

Findings are warnings, and the exit code is 0. To make them errors, add `--deny`. For
a machine-readable report, add `--format json`.

ASD-STE100 approves approximately 900 words, and it rejects every other word. Thus your
project must declare its own Technical Names and Technical Verbs. Write them in
`docs/glossary.nix`, or give another path with `--glossary`:

```nix
{
  names = [ "server" { name = "oauth"; desc = "the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow"; } ];
  verbs = [ "parse" ];
}
```

A name is approved as a noun and a verb is approved as a verb. To make the first file,
run `ste_checker --suggest-glossary` on your Markdown. It writes each word that is not
in the approved vocabulary. Delete each word that is ordinary English, and write a
description for each word that you keep.

Set `text_type` to `description` in the configuration file to permit 25 words in a
sentence instead of 20. Put rule names in `disable` to switch rules off.
