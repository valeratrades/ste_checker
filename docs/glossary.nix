# Technical Names and Technical Verbs this project owns. ASD-STE100 section 1, rule 1.5.
# A name is approved as a noun, a verb as a verb; a word used both ways appears twice.
#
# Most of these are the vocabulary of grammar, which this program is about and the standard's
# approved wordlist has no reason to carry.
