//! The generators every target draws from: one Markdown document, and one glossary with its Nix
//! rendering. They live together because a target's fingerprint is over the sources that decide
//! what its `(seed, size)` means, and that is this file plus the target's own.
//!
//! The word pools are chosen for what they make the rules do, not for realism: each one is a class
//! some rule or some part of `tags.rs` treats differently, so a document is a mix of the cases that
//! disagree rather than of English.
